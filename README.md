Hero is a remake of a game that always caught my attention "Space Invaders" but with a saterical Coding twist! I designed the spaceship and the Alien Invaders on Piskel. I had waaayy to much fun designing them! You can move it the spaceship with "Up" "Down" "Right" "Left" arrows. My overall goal was to create a storyline, seperated by levels, but to also give you more mobility than the 1978 game. I wanted to keep the pixel aestetic that feels very nostalgic and also still elaborate on the designs, story and game play as well. Hoping to create levels and have possible multiple players? that would be cool!
